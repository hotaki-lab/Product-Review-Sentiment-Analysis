# INTRODUCTION:
The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively.

Below are two example entries from our dataset. Each entry consists of the review and its label. The two reviews were written by different customers describing their experience with a sugar-free candy.
